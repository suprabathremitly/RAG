# ðŸ“¤ GitHub Upload Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to upload your RAG project to GitHub.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- GitHub account created
- Terminal/Command Prompt access

---

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Visit https://github.com
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create New Repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
   - Select "New repository"

3. **Configure Repository:**
   - **Repository name:** `RAG_1` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** "AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment - RAG system with auto-enrichment"
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we'll create one)
   - **DO NOT** add license yet
   - Click "Create repository"

4. **Copy Repository URL:**
   - You'll see a URL like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAG_1.git`
   - Keep this handy!

---

### Step 2: Prepare Your Local Repository

Open terminal in your project directory (`/Users/suprabathc/Documents/augment-projects/RAG_1`):

```bash
# Navigate to project directory (if not already there)
cd /Users/suprabathc/Documents/augment-projects/RAG_1

# Initialize git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Check git status
git status
```

---

### Step 3: Create .gitignore File

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive and unnecessary files:

```bash
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
venv/
env/
ENV/
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
wheels/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Data directories (contains user uploads and database)
data/uploads/*
data/chroma_db/*
data/ratings.jsonl

# Keep directory structure but ignore contents
!data/uploads/.gitkeep
!data/chroma_db/.gitkeep

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~
.DS_Store

# Testing
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/
.tox/

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# OS
Thumbs.db
.DS_Store
EOF
```

---

### Step 4: Create Placeholder Files for Empty Directories

```bash
# Create .gitkeep files to preserve directory structure
touch data/uploads/.gitkeep
touch data/chroma_db/.gitkeep
```

---

### Step 5: Create a LICENSE File

```bash
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'
MIT License

EOF
```

### Step 6: Stage and Commit Files

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-Powered Knowledge Base with RAG and Auto-Enrichment

Features:
- Multi-format document upload (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Semantic search with ChromaDB
- GPT-4 powered answers with confidence scoring
- Completeness detection and missing info identification
- Auto-enrichment from Wikipedia, arXiv, PubMed
- Rating system for user feedback
- Modern dark UI with glassmorphism
- Comprehensive tests and documentation"
```

---

### Step 7: Connect to GitHub and Push

```bash
# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAG_1.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub (main branch)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**If prompted for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a Personal Access Token (not your password)

**To create a Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "RAG_1 Upload"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password

---

### Step 8: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAG_1`
2. Verify all files are present
3. Check that README.md is displayed nicely
4. Verify .gitignore is working (data/uploads and data/chroma_db should be empty)

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Optional: Add Repository Enhancements

### Add Topics/Tags

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics: `rag`, `ai`, `gpt-4`, `fastapi`, `chromadb`, `knowledge-base`, `semantic-search`, `python`

### Add Repository Description

In the "About" section, add:
```
AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment - RAG system with auto-enrichment from trusted sources
```

### Add Website URL

If you deploy it, add the URL in the "About" section

---

## ðŸ”„ Future Updates

When you make changes to your code:

```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add feature: [describe your change]"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## ðŸŒ¿ Branching Strategy (Optional)

For collaborative development:

```bash
# Create a new branch for a feature
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# After review, merge to main
```

---

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "fatal: remote origin already exists"

```bash
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add it again
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAG_1.git
```

### Issue: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work"

```bash
# Pull first, then push
git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main
```

### Issue: Authentication failed

- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys (more secure)

### Issue: Large files rejected

```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M

# If you have large files, add them to .gitignore
echo "large_file.bin" >> .gitignore
git rm --cached large_file.bin
git commit -m "Remove large file"
```
