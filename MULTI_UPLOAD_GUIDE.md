## üéØ Supported File Types

- **PDF** (`.pdf`) - Portable Document Format
- **Text** (`.txt`) - Plain text files
- **Word** (`.docx`) - Microsoft Word documents

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### 1. **File Size**
- Keep individual files under 50MB for best performance
- Very large files may take longer to process

### 2. **File Names**
- Use descriptive filenames
- Avoid special characters
- Good: `company_policy_2024.pdf`
- Avoid: `doc!!!@#$.pdf`

### 3. **Content Quality**
- Ensure PDFs contain actual text (not just images)
- Use clear, well-formatted documents
- Remove unnecessary pages to reduce processing time

### 4. **Batch Size**
- Upload 5-10 files at a time for optimal performance
- For larger batches, consider splitting into multiple uploads

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Upload failed" for all files

**Cause**: Missing or invalid OpenAI API key

**Solution**:
1. Check the `.env` file in the project root
2. Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to your actual key
3. See `SETUP_API_KEY.md` for detailed instructions
4. Restart the server after updating the key

### Problem: Some files fail with "Unsupported file format"

**Cause**: File type not supported

**Solution**:
- Only upload PDF, TXT, or DOCX files
- Convert other formats to one of these types first
- Check file extensions are correct

### Problem: Upload is very slow

**Cause**: Large files or many files at once

**Solution**:
- Upload fewer files at a time
- Split large documents into smaller sections
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your OpenAI API has sufficient quota

### Problem: Files upload but don't appear in the list

**Cause**: Browser cache or display issue

**Solution**:
- Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify files are in the `data/uploads` directory

## üé® UI Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- **Hover Effect**: Upload area highlights when you hover
- **Drag Feedback**: Border changes color when dragging files
- **Progress Indicator**: Loading animation during upload
- **Status Messages**: Clear success/error messages with details

### Better Error Messages
- Specific error for each failed file
- Helpful tips for common issues
- Link to setup documentation

## üìù API Endpoint

If you're using the API directly:

```bash
# Upload multiple files
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/documents/upload-multiple" \
  -F "files=@document1.pdf" \
  -F "files=@document2.txt" \
  -F "files=@document3.docx"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "successful_uploads": [
    {
      "document_id": "abc-123",
      "filename": "document1.pdf",
      "file_size": 102400,
      "file_type": "pdf",
      "chunks_created": 68
    }
  ],
  "failed_uploads": [],
  "total_uploaded": 1,
  "total_failed": 0
}
```

## üîÑ What Happens During Upload

1. **File Validation**: Checks file format is supported
2. **Content Extraction**: Extracts text from the document
3. **Chunking**: Splits text into manageable chunks
4. **Embedding**: Creates vector embeddings using OpenAI
5. **Storage**: Saves to vector database for searching
6. **Confirmation**: Shows success message with details

## üéØ Next Steps

After uploading your documents:

1. **Ask Questions**: Use the search box to query your knowledge base
2. **View Documents**: See all uploaded documents in the left panel
3. **Delete Documents**: Remove documents you no longer need
4. **Rate Answers**: Help improve the system by rating responses
