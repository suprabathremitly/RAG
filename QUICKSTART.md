# Quick Start Guide

Get your RAG Knowledge Base up and running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed
- **OpenAI API Key** ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Terminal/Command Line** access

## Step 1: Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Make setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run setup
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create necessary directories
- Generate a `.env` file

## Step 2: Configure (1 minute)

Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Edit .env file
nano .env

# Or use your preferred editor
code .env
```

Add your API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

Save and close the file.

## Step 3: Run (1 minute)

```bash
# Make run script executable
chmod +x run.sh

# Start the application
./run.sh
```

You should see:
```
üöÄ Starting AI-Powered Knowledge Base...
üåê Starting server on http://localhost:8000
üìö API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Step 4: Use (1 minute)

### Option A: Web Interface

1. Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8000**
2. Upload a document (PDF, TXT, or DOCX)
3. Ask a question in the search box
4. Get your AI-generated answer!

### Option B: API

```bash
# Upload a document
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/documents/upload" \
  -F "file=@examples/sample_document.txt"

# Ask a question
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the remote work policy?"}'
```

## Step 5: Test with Sample Data

```bash
# Run the example test script
python examples/test_api.py
```

This will:
- Upload the sample document
- Run several test queries
- Demonstrate all features
- Show you how the system works

## Example Workflow

### 1. Upload Documents
```bash
# Upload company handbook
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/documents/upload" \
  -F "file=@handbook.pdf"

# Upload policy document
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/documents/upload" \
  -F "file=@policies.docx"
```

### 2. Ask Questions
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is the vacation policy?",
    "top_k": 5,
    "enable_auto_enrichment": false
  }'
```

### 3. Get Structured Response
```json
{
  "query": "What is the vacation policy?",
  "answer": "According to the employee handbook, new employees receive 15 days of vacation per year...",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "is_complete": true,
  "sources": [
    {
      "document_name": "handbook.pdf",
      "relevance_score": 0.95,
      "content": "Vacation Policy: New employees..."
    }
  ],
  "missing_info": [],
  "enrichment_suggestions": []
}
```

### 4. Rate the Answer
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/rate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is the vacation policy?",
    "answer": "According to...",
    "rating": 5,
    "feedback": "Very helpful!"
  }'
```

## Understanding the Response

### Confidence Score
- **0.8 - 1.0** üü¢ High confidence - answer is well-supported
- **0.5 - 0.8** üü° Medium confidence - answer is partially supported
- **0.0 - 0.5** üî¥ Low confidence - limited information

### Completeness
- **Complete** ‚úÖ All information available
- **Incomplete** ‚ö†Ô∏è Some information missing (check `missing_info`)

### When Answer is Incomplete
The system will:
1. Tell you what information is missing
2. Suggest documents to upload
3. Offer to fetch info from external sources (if enabled)

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Company Knowledge Base
Upload: Employee handbooks, policies, procedures
Ask: "What is the remote work policy?", "How do I request time off?"

### 2. Product Documentation
Upload: User guides, API docs, FAQs
Ask: "How do I configure X?", "What are the system requirements?"

### 3. Research Assistant
Upload: Research papers, articles, notes
Ask: "What are the main findings?", "How does X relate to Y?"

### 4. Legal/Compliance
Upload: Contracts, regulations, guidelines
Ask: "What are the requirements for X?", "Is Y compliant?"

## Tips for Best Results

### üìÑ Document Upload
- Upload related documents together
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Ensure documents contain actual text (not just images)
- Break very large documents into sections

### üîç Asking Questions
- Be specific and clear
- Use natural language
- Include context when needed
- Try different phrasings if needed

### üéØ Improving Accuracy
- Upload more relevant documents
- Use enrichment suggestions
- Enable auto-enrichment for general knowledge
- Rate answers to help improve the system

## Troubleshooting

### "No documents found"
**Solution**: Upload documents first before searching

### Low confidence scores
**Solution**: 
- Upload more relevant documents
- Enable auto-enrichment
- Rephrase your question

### "Connection refused"
**Solution**: Make sure the server is running (`./run.sh`)
