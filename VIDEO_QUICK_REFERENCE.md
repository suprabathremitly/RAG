Tell me about the Eiffel Tower?
Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2023?
```

## üíª CODE SNIPPETS TO HIGHLIGHT

### **1. Auto-Enrichment Logic** (`rag_pipeline.py` lines 93-118)
```python
# Step 4: Automatic enrichment - fetch from external sources ONLY if answer is incomplete
if not llm_response.is_complete and llm_response.missing_info:
    # Answer is incomplete - automatically fetch from trusted external sources
    logger.info(f"Answer incomplete (confidence: {llm_response.confidence}). Auto-fetching from external sources")
    
    llm_response.enrichment_suggestions = await self._generate_enrichment_suggestions(
        query=query,
        answer=llm_response.answer,
        missing_info=llm_response.missing_info,
        enable_auto_enrichment=True  # Always enable when answer is incomplete
    )
```

**Say:** "This is where the magic happens - if the answer is incomplete, it automatically triggers enrichment."

---

### **2. Structured Output** (`schemas.py` lines 45-56)
```python
class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for search queries with structured output."""
    query: str
    answer: str
    confidence: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    is_complete: bool
    sources: List[SourceReference]
    missing_info: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    enrichment_suggestions: List[EnrichmentSuggestion] = Field(default_factory=list)
    auto_enrichment_applied: bool = False
```

**Say:** "Everything is strongly typed - confidence from 0 to 1, boolean completeness flag, missing info list."

---

### **3. Trusted Sources** (`enrichment_engine.py` lines 20-35)
```python
TRUSTED_SOURCES = {
    "wikipedia": {
        "priority": 1,
        "description": "General knowledge encyclopedia",
        "enabled": True
    },
    "arxiv": {
        "priority": 2,
        "description": "Academic papers and research",
        "enabled": True
    },
    "pubmed": {
        "priority": 3,
        "description": "Medical and life sciences research",
        "enabled": True
    },
}
```

**Say:** "Priority-based system - Wikipedia first, then arXiv for academic, PubMed for medical."
